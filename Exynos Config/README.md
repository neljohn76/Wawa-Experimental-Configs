# 🔹 Exynos Vulkan-Forced Config (Experimental)

> Built for **Exynos SoCs (Mali GPUs)** — pushing Vulkan rendering and reflection quality to their limits.

---

## ⚙️ Overview
This config forces **Vulkan rendering** on Exynos devices, optimizing Mali GPU behavior for smoother frame pacing and better visual effects.

---

## 💡 Key Features
- `r.GraphicsRHI=Vulkan` (forced rendering)  
- Enhanced **reflections and shadows**  
- Reduced **shader stutter**  
- Balanced **particle effects** (leaves, smoke)  
- Improved **thread scheduling** for big.LITTLE CPUs  

---

## ⚠️ Warning
- **Always backup your current config files!**  
  Copy your existing `Engine.ini` and `DeviceProfiles.ini` before replacing them.  
- Some **older Mali GPUs** may show flickering or texture issues under Vulkan.

---

## 💡 Tips
- Disable battery saving mode for consistent performance.  
- Use this with **One UI Game Booster set to “Performance.”**  
- If Vulkan fails, rename or delete `Engine.ini` to revert to defaults.
